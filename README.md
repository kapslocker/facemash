Comparision between performances by Eigenface vs Fisherface techniques
A C++ implementation of the methods described in the paper: Eigenfaces vs. Fisherfaces: Recognition using class specific linear projection
This was implemented as an assignment for the course ELL784: Introduction to Machine Learning at IIT Delhi.

It compares predictions based on PCA and Fisher's LDA methods. The dataset used is the Cropped Yale dataset.
